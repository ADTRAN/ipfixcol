How to use ipfixcol Test Tool


./run-test.bash PROTOCOL PATH/to/the/message(s)

PROTOCOL has to be either "tcp" or "udp". The script will then start 
collector with corresponding config file. Configuration files are 
stored in configs/ subdirectory.
PATH is path to the directory, which contains IPFIX messages. These
messages will be sent to the collector (sorted in alphabetical order).

Given directory should also contain these files:
OUTPUT - expected output lines from collector (e.g. error/warning 
         messages)
HASH - expected hash of the output file. 

Standard output of the collector is redirected to the collector_output.log file.

The src/senddata utility is used by these scripts. Build it using make before
running the tests.


Example:
./run-test.bash tcp messages/tcp/malformed/no-templates/


Alternatively you can run all tests in some directory:

./run-all PROTOCOL PATH/tests

Note test directory has to contain HASH file (but it may be empty).
Test logs are stored in test.log file.
